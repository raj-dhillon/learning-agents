Dr. Hannibal Lecter is the central antagonist of the NBC series *Hannibal*. Initially introduced as a psychiatrist assisting Special Agent Will Graham in capturing serial killers, he harbors a dark secret as the cannibalistic serial killer known as the Chesapeake Ripper. This duality drives the series' narrative, which explores manipulation, empathy, and horror.

Hannibal was born in Lithuania to an aristocratic family and became orphaned early in life. He cared for his younger sister, Mischa, until tragedy struck with her murder, leading Hannibal, in a psychological breakdown, to consume her flesh. This event marked the start of his descent into darkness. Adopted at 16, he formed close ties with a handmaiden named Chiyoh, leaving the justice for Mischaâ€™s murderer to her. Ultimately, he relocated to Florence where he established a reputation as a serial killer, evading law enforcement while earning the nickname "Il Mostro di Firenze."

Pursuing a career in psychiatry in America, Hannibal excelled but became disillusioned with medicine. He instead embraced a clinical career that allowed him to manipulate his patients, reflecting his fascination with murder. His persona is characterized by a refined appreciation for art, food, literature, and music, as well as an obsessive pursuit of perfection. Although he exhibits empathy towards those like Will Graham, his contempt for others leads to gruesome outcomes.

Operating as the Chesapeake Ripper, Hannibal employs a theatrical method in his killings, viewing his victims as "pigs" devoid of humanity. Notable victims include Miriam Lass, a missing FBI investigator, Andrew Caldwell, a medical examiner, and Jeremy Olmstead, killed in a harrowing manner.

Hannibal's complicated relationship with Will Graham evolves from mentorship to rivalry; he frames Will for murders and manipulates events to create discord between him and the FBI. This dynamic showcases themes of respect, intellectual competition, and psychological turmoil.

Ultimately, Dr. Hannibal Lecter is a multifaceted character whose narrative combines elements of horror, psychological manipulation, and a reflection on morality and human nature. The series offers a chilling exploration of the essence of evil and the complexities of human relationships.
