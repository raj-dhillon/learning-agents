Kratos, also known as Fárbauti in Norse mythology, is the central figure of the God of War series. A demigod, he is the offspring of Zeus and the mortal Callisto, and he has a brother named Deimos. His narrative centers around a relentless quest for vengeance against the gods, plagued by deep-rooted guilt and regret stemming from his brutal past. Initially a Spartan general, Kratos becomes embroiled in the violent intrigues of Olympus, which leads to the heartbreaking loss of his family due to his servitude to Ares, the God of War. Ares deceives him into killing his wife and daughter, prompting Kratos to renounce his allegiance and seek retribution against the Olympian pantheon, resulting in numerous confrontations and the deaths of several deities, including Ares and Zeus.

Transitioning from Greece to the Norse realm, Kratos strives to establish a new life after the death of his wife, Faye, while raising his son Atreus. Their quest to fulfill Faye's last wish of spreading her ashes introduces a new chapter, one that forces Kratos to grapple not only with his tumultuous past but also with formidable adversaries among Norse gods like Baldur and Thor. Central themes of fatherhood, loss, and the intricate balance between fate and free will come to prominence as their journey unfolds.

Ultimately, Kratos confronts Odin in a cataclysmic conflict known as Ragnarök, driven by a desire to protect Atreus and to break the violent cycle that has characterized his existence. Throughout the series, Kratos undergoes significant transformation—from the vengeful "Ghost of Sparta" to a more multi-dimensional figure who acknowledges the complexities of his deity status, embracing the responsibilities of fatherhood. His evolution marks him as the "God of War" for the Nine Realms, aiming to make reparations for his previous sins and ensuring that Atreus learns from his mistakes, aspiring to honor rather than annihilate as he builds a legacy of hope.
