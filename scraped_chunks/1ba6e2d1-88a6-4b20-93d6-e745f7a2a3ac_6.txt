He was slated to go to Princeton before his discovery of Brakebills, and was able to beat the Madness Maker, a rogue trickster magician who went insane, at his own game,[4] a testament to his intellect.

Quentin's understanding of magical theory allowed him to create the ritual used to bring back Alice from her state as a Niffin[6], a feat no other Magician in history could accomplish.
